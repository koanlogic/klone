QUICKSTART
----------

NOTE: KLone needs GNU make in order to be built, which is not the default 'make'
      on most *BSD systems (usually you will find it as 'gmake' or 'gnumake').

1) Setup compilation environment:

    $ cd makl && ${GNUMAKE} hints

    [ set MAKEFLAGS and MAKL_DIR environment variables as suggested ]
    [ possibly in the startup files of your shell.                  ]

    $ ${GNUMAKE} toolchain
    $ cd ..

2) Configure and build KLone:

    $ ./configure && ${GNUMAKE}

3) Import the example web-application

    $ ${GNUMAKE} depend
    $ cd site && ../src/tools/klone/klone -c import ../doc/example-site
    $ cd .. && ${GNUMAKE}
    $ su
    # ${GNUMAKE} install

4) Launch the KLone executable:

    $ kloned

5) Start your web browser:

    [ start your web browser and go to http://localhost:4567/ ]
