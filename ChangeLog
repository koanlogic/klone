ChangeLog file of KLone - http://koanlogic.com

KLone X.Y.Z:
	- tls: force usage of TLSv1+ [CVE-2014-3566 POODLE]
	- webapp: fix background and update copyright
	- reponse: missing response_del_field() declaration in header (patch
	  provided by Mickael Auger)

KLone 3.1.0:
	- *BSD license*
	- Fix timeout initialisation upon select() errors.
	- timerm_reschedule() to reset alarm in signal handler.

KLone 3.0.0:
	- Add IPv6, SCTP, and UNIX IPC support via libu/net.  This change breaks
	  the four following interfaces: request_[gs]et_{local,peer}_addr() which
	  now take and return a constant string instead of a kaddr_t.  Further,
	  the 'addr' directive value syntax has changed in non retro-compatible
	  way -- it's now based on libu/net URIs syntax, e.g.: tcp6://[::1]:8080; 
	  the 'addr.port' and 'addr.type' directives are now suppressed, since 
	  they've been absorbed by the 'addr'; and the 'backlog' directive is 
	  temporarily inhibited (it needs an interface shift in libu/net) and
	  is internally fixed to U_NET_BACKLOG, defaulting to 300.
	- New server loop hook (patch provided by Mickael Auger)
	- Conditional compilation and linking of hooks
	- Fix build when fork(2) is missing, as in uClinux.
	- Fix bug in memory session configuration that prevented use of default
	  values (reported and fixed by Davide Berra).
	- Fix SSL compilation flags missing during cross-compilation.
	- Fix partially uploaded files not cleaned up.
	- Fix bad buffer length in {http,supemb}_is_valid_uri() (reported by
	  Senén de Diego).
	- Multipart/form-data fixes.

KLone 2.4.0:
	- max size estimate of encrypted sessions fixed (session_prv_calc_maxsize)
	- CyaSSL support (HTTPS, resource encryption and client-side sessions)
	- session_set_cipher_key added
	- fix warning caused by missing newline in generated source (reported and 
	  fixed by Mickael Auger)
	- configure: removed redundant parameter from featx doxygen

KLone 2.3.0:
	- Minix 3.8.1 port
	- OpenSolaris+SunStudioExpress port
	- fix a 64-bit platform problem about correct identification of file based
	  sessions
	- fix not-firing timers (reported by Mickael Auger)
	- libu2 merge: use hmap "easy" interface with embfs; integrated JSON
	  encoder/decoder; simplified networking; native BST, priority queue,
	  ring buffer and dynamic arrays.
	- "-c command-line" argument to override configuration
	- apply chroot from configuration under OS_WIN
	- fix minor bug in build (bad clean in makl subdir)
	- exec_page() argument name switched from 'args' to a slightly less 
	  common '_dyp_args' to avoid clash with user local vars
	- fix error page configuration failure on URLs with arguments
	- new emb_list (and emb_list_free) interface to list embfs resources
	- added sample RedHat init script

KLone 2.2.1:
	- fix "can't shift that many" build error on Ubuntu 9 and NetBSD
	- urlencoded variables parsed also when Content-Length == 0 on POSTs
	- added 'temp_dir' configuration variable to override system default temp 
	  directory (L_tmpnam, TMPDIR & friends)
	- added 'klone_sid' configuration variable to override default cookie name
	- HTTPS fix (rollback to http.c:1.64) output io_t dup'd from input io_t
	- added session_get_id() to retrieve a given session id string
	- fix request_get_uploaded_file() prototype (suggested buffer size was
	  wrong and could lead to overruns)
	- added '-n' command line switch to kloned: don't chdir(2) when
	  daemon'izing 

KLone 2.2.0:
	- new url-regex dispatcher (kilt)
	- don't fail on PUT and DELETE requests
	- -fstack-protector-all added by default when supported by the compiler
	- better depencecies check: .d and .kld depend files created (and included)

	- added TLS PSK interface
	- page entry point function fixed to avoid g++ errors 
	- libu sync to export u_pwd module
