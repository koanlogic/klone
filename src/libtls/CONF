_________
cert_file       PEM-encoded certificate file for the server and optionally 
                also to the corresponding RSA or DSA Private Key file for it 
                (contained in the same file).  The certificate must be 
                configured with the Common Name matching the fully qualified 
                domain name of the server (FIXME: check RFC).
                This parameter is mandatory.

default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.cert_file     /path/to/server_cert.pem


________
key_file        PEM-encoded private key file for the server. If the private 
                key is not combined with the certificate in the 'cert_file', 
                use this additional directive to point to the file with the 
                stand-alone private key.  When 'cert_file' is used and the 
                file contains both the certificate and the private key this 
                directive need not be used.  But we strongly discourage this 
                practice.  Instead we recommend you to separate the certificate
                and the private key.  

default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.key_file     /path/to/server_key.pem


______________
certchain_file  optional all-in-one file where you can assemble the 
                certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) which form 
                the certificate chain of the server certificate.  This starts 
                with the issuing CA certificate of of the server certificate 
                and can range up to the root CA certificate.  Such a file is 
                simply the concatenation of the various PEM-encoded CA 
                Certificate files, usually in certificate chain order.
                This is intended for instance for the Verisign Global-ID 
                situation where one _has_ to send the intermediate CA of 
                Verisign with the GID while one wants to avoid that under 
                client authentication all clients issued by this CA are 
                accepted (which would happen when one references the CA 
                cert via 'ca_file'.

default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.certchain_file    /path/to/ca_bundle_server.pem


_______
ca_file         all-in-one file where you can assemble the certificates 
                of Certification Authorities (CA) for all certificates 
                expected from clients.  These are used for Client 
                authentication.  Such a file is simply the concatenation 
                of the various PEM-encoded certificate files, in order of 
                preference.  It is mandatory when verify_client is 
                "required".

default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.ca_file   /path/to/ca_bundle_client.pem
    

_______
dh_file         PEM-encoded file containing Diffie-Hellman parameters to be 
                used on session data negotiation phase.  When missing a 
                default set of 1024-bit DH parameters is used.  Note that
                RSA ephemeral parameters are always created automatically.

default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.dh_file     /path/to/dh_params.pem


____________
verify_depth    This directive sets how deeply openssl should verify before 
                deciding that the clients don't have a valid certificate.  
                The depth actually is the maximum number of intermediate 
                certificate issuers, i.e. the number of CA certificates which 
                are max allowed to be followed while verifying the client 
                certificate.  A depth of 0 means that self-signed client 
                certificates are accepted only, the default depth of 1 means 
                the client certificate can be self-signed or has to be signed 
                by a CA which is directly known to the server (i.e. the CA's 
                certificate is under 'ca_file'), etc. 

default:        1
syntax:         server.httpsd.verify_depth  10

                    
_____________
verify_client   This directive sets the certificate verification level for 
                the Client authentication.  The following values are available:
                * "no"       -> no client certificate is required at all 
                * "optional" -> the client may present a valid certificate
                * "required" -> the client has to present a valid certificate.
                Note: "optional" makes sense only in testing scenarios.
                
default:        "no"
syntax:         server.httpsd.verify_depth  required


________
crl_file        CRL file
default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.crl   /path/to/crl.pem


________
crl_opts        CRL check mode:
                * "all"      -> check all certificates in chain against a CRL
                * "client"   -> check only the client certificate for revocation
                                status
default:        none
syntax:         server.httpsd.crl_opts  all
